## Quick Start

Get up and running with LogBooking Templates in just a few steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/cap10bill/logbook-template.git
   cd logbook-template
   ```

2. **Import Templates/Snippets into Your IDE**
   - **JetBrains:**  
     You can import templates two ways:
     1. **Direct Import:** Go to `File > Settings > Editor > Live Templates`, then import the XML file from `tools/jetbrains/`.
     2. **Manual Copy:** Follow the instructions in [tools/jetbrains/README.md](../tools/jetbrains/README.md) to copy the XML file directly into your JetBrains configuration folder for your OS (Windows, macOS, Linux).
   - **VS Code:**  
     Open `File > Preferences > User Snippets`, then add the JSON file from `tools/vscode/`.

3. **Run a Log Generation Script**
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```sh
     python tools/scripts/generate-new-logbook-entry.py
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to create a new log entry.

4. **Start Logging**
   - Use the provided shortcuts and templates in your IDE, or the generated log files in the `logbooks/` folder.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Having trouble getting started or using the templates? Here are answers to common questions:**

### 1. Template Not Appearing in JetBrains IDE
- **Solution:**
  - Double-check that you copied the XML file to the correct `templates` folder for your IDE version and OS. See [tools/jetbrains/README.md](../tools/jetbrains/README.md) for exact paths.
  - Restart your IDE after copying the file.
  - Verify under **File > Settings > Editor > Live Templates** that the template is listed.

### 2. VS Code Snippet Not Working
- **Solution:**
  - Make sure you added the JSON file to the correct snippet location: **File > Preferences > User Snippets**.
  - Reload VS Code after adding the snippet.

### 3. Python Script Won't Run
- **Solution:**
  - Ensure Python 3.x is installed: run `python --version` in your terminal.
  - If you see errors, check [tools/scripts/README.md](../tools/scripts/README.md) for troubleshooting steps.

### 4. Where Are My Log Files?
- **Solution:**
  - Generated log files are saved in the appropriate folder under `logbooks/` (e.g., `logbooks/learning-skills/`).

### 5. How Do I Customize a Template?
- **Solution:**
  - Edit the XML (JetBrains) or JSON (VS Code) template files directly, or modify the markdown templates in `tools/scripts/logbooking-templates/`.

## How to Use These Templates

### In Your IDE

**For JetBrains Users:**
- **Import the Templates:**
  - **Direct Import:** Navigate to **File > Settings > Editor > Live Templates** (or **IntelliJ IDEA > Preferences > Editor > Live Templates** on macOS). Import the XML file from `tools/jetbrains/`.
  - **Manual Copy:** See [tools/jetbrains/README.md](../tools/jetbrains/README.md) for step-by-step instructions to copy the XML file into your JetBrains configuration folder for Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Trigger and Customize:** Type the shortcut (for example, `.sh` or `.logpr`), press **Tab** to expand, and fill in your placeholders using the **Tab** key.

**For Visual Studio Code Users:**
- **Import Snippets:** Use the VS Code snippet file located in `tools/vscode/`. Open **File > Preferences > User Snippets** and add the JSON file.
- **Insert and Edit:** Type the snippet prefix, select from the suggestions, and use **Tab** to move between fields.

### Run the Log Generation Scripts

**Script Usage Example:**
- Open a terminal and run:
  ```sh
  python tools/scripts/generate-new-logbook-entry.py
  ```
- The script will prompt you for details (title, description, date, etc.) and automatically create a log file in the appropriate `logbooks/` folder.
- **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. If you encounter issues, see [tools/scripts/README.md](../tools/scripts/README.md) for troubleshooting tips.

## Advanced Tips & Pro Techniques

Take your logbooking to the next level with these advanced strategies:

### 1. Automate Log Generation
- **Batch Logging:** Use scripts in `tools/scripts/` to automate repetitive log entry creation. For example, schedule `generate-new-logbook-entry.py` to run at the end of each workday.
- **Integrate with Git Hooks:** Automatically generate or update log entries when you commit code by adding logbook scripts to your Git hooks.

### 2. Version Control Your Logbooks
- **Keep Adding:** Instead of overwriting or pruning, keep adding new entries and create new volumes as your logbooks grow. The real value comes from seeing the full journey and adjusting as you learn.
- **Review Often:** Skim your logs regularly—both randomly and as part of your workflow. You won't always know what worked until you see the data later, so more is generally better.
- **Learn by Looking Back:** Use your logs to spot patterns, reflect on progress, and make informed adjustments over time.

### 3. Customize Templates for Your Team
- **Edit Template Files:** Modify XML (JetBrains) or JSON (VS Code) files to add fields, change defaults, or create new templates tailored to your workflow.
- **Share Custom Templates:** Distribute your custom templates to teammates for consistent logging across your organization.

### 4. Link Logs to Issues and Pull Requests
- **Reference IDs:** Include issue or PR IDs in your log entries to create traceability between logs and your project management tools.
- **Cross-link Markdown:** Use markdown links to connect log entries with related documentation, code reviews, or external resources.

### 5. Use Markdown Best Practices
- **Accessibility:** Add alt text to images and use clear table headers for screen readers.
- **Consistent Formatting:** Use headings, lists, and code blocks to make logs easy to scan and understand.

### 6. Analyze and Report from Logbooks
- **Export Data:** Periodically export logbook data to CSV or other formats for analysis.
- **Review Trends:** Use your logs to identify recurring issues, track progress, and inform retrospectives.

### 7. Secure Sensitive Information
- **Redact or Encrypt:** Avoid logging sensitive credentials or personal data. If necessary, redact or encrypt sensitive sections before sharing logs.
